# Catalog for Recipes

## Why?

- I am tired of all the recipe booklets that I have and I want to condense them into a place to look at.

## Goals

- Set up an env to upload recipe PDFs
- Try to parse common items from PDFs such as titles
    - Allow a UI to customize the parsed content if it is not good enough
- Allow search of recipe by ingredients
- Allow search of recipe by title
- Allow tagging of recipe
- Allow search of recipe by tags
- Long term:
    - Classification of recipe by type of food(bfast, lunch, dinner, desert, etc)
- Export all PDFs stored into a single merged PDF for sharing
    - Include index of each recipe title
